  <h1>Primer: How Computers Work</h1><p>By <a href="https://www.davekilian.com">Dave Kilian</a></p><hr>
</div>
Welcome to *Primer*! Like the title says: In this book, you'll learn how computers work.

It's (unfortunately) kind of hard to get a straight answer on how computers work! There's a lot of information out there, but to my knowledge, nobody has gone and done the job of picking the important information and organizing it an easy-to-understand way. That's my goal with this book. Even though we'll be covering some technical concepts, I aim to make this book an easy read for everyone &mdash; non-coders included. I hope you enjoy it!

You can always find the latest version of this book at [https://davekilian.com/primer/](https://davekilian.com/primer). Techies: if you find any typos, mistakes or anything that just could have been written better, please don't hesitate to let me know by [filing a GitHub issue against this book](https://github.com/davekilian/primer/issues). For minor corrections, feel free to fork [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/davekilian/primer) and submit a pull request with a fix. Note that, because of the way this book is published, all content is on the `gh-pages` branch instead of `main` or `master`.

Ready? Then let's get started!

## Overview

So, what's this book about? As you'll see soon, computers rely on a complex dance between two interlinked worlds:

* The **hardware**, the physical device that runs software
* The **software**, program code which tells the hardware what to do

These two worlds are linked by a body of software code that has no real name. You might hear people call it "systems code," or the "platform," or as an amalgamation of terms like "operating system," "database," "runtime," &mdash;Â or even "magic" ðŸ™‚. Whatever you call it, this code is often forgotten: hardware people tend to see it as part of the software, and software people tend to see it as part of the hardware! It's a shame this code is often handwaved over or forgotten about, because it's where a lot of the important stuff happens. Systems code will be a major focus of this book.

More important than what we cover will be how we cover it. This book is also about *why* computers work the way they do. Tech is unlike the other arms of STEM: in science and math, you study things that were shaped by natural forces or logic, respectively, so in those fields, it's not quite right to ask 'why' things are they way they are: they simply *are*. But, in tech, 'why' should always be your first question! Everything in tech is that way for a reason: someone had some problem they were trying to solve, and thought this would be the best way to solve the problem. This book is about the problems and solutions that go into a computer.

## Why read this book?

If you're not already a coder or work in tech, here are some things you might get out of this book:

**A new way of thinking**: I love the kind of thinking you do when you work on computers, and I'm hoping, in this book, you'll get some practice with this kind of thinking. In other words, reading this book should hopefully be kind of fun! ðŸ™‚

**Satisfying your curiosity**: If you've ever wondered how and why computers work the way they do, here's a complete answer. No handwaving, I promise!

If you're already working in tech, I think you'll find the information in this book to be a kind of superpower!

**Better, faster, cleaner code**: The more you understand about the hardware and software which supports and runs your code, the easier a time you'll have writing code that fits 'naturally' into the platform it runs on.

**New kinds of computers**: Understanding the "why" behind the decisions that went into your computer will help you chart a new path into new kinds of computers &mdash;Â big computers like the cloud, little computers like wearables, or maybe even something else!

Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention there's big money working on the kind of hardware and software described in this book. These developers are highly sought after, and they make the big bucks!
