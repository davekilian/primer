If you've ever felt frustrated that computers seem like magic, or that explainations involve too much hand-waving, or if you'd just like to learn more about computers, this book is for you.

This is a book about how computers work, from the ground up. We're going to cover real-world, modern computers: the kind you're using to read this book right now, as well as the network that delivered this book into your hands &mdash; downloading this page may have been easy for you, but sure was no mean feat for the computers you used to do so!

In this book, we'll start at the most basic level: what a computer is, what it does, and how you would build a simple computer using electrical circuitry. Then we'll build up to modern computers, covering topics like

* How your computer represents numbers, text, images, sound, video and more
* How developers program computers, and how these programming tools work
* The hardware devices inside your computer, and how software uses them
* Operating systems, the basic software that most programs are built on top of
* How computers network together, and how the Internet works
* Advanced topics and recent developments in the field

One thing we *won't* do in this book is dive into any of these topics in detail &mdash; there are lots of great resources out there for each, and getting in the weeds here would make this book unbearably long. We're going to instead walk through these major moving pieces and see roughly how they work and fit together. My goal is to make sure you're well-equipped to dive deeper in any topic that interests you.

I wrote this book because nothing like it exists, as far as I know, and I think it should. When I was in school, I used to spend hours on (in retrospect, hopelessly nerdy) websites like [HowStuffWorks](https://www.howstuffworks.com), and I remember having a lot of trouble finding a good resource to *really* explain how computers work. Sure there were plenty of posts and articles willing to take a stab, but they always ended too quickly, often with a big handwave, leaving me feeling like I didn't really get it yet. My continued failure to find a good answer to the (seeimgly basic?) question of how computers work dragged me down deeper and deeper into the field &mdash; which is how, over a decade later, I find myself working on computers professionally today :-)

This book is a culmination of over a decade of learning about and working on computers at all levels, sometimes piecing things together from historical context or reading tea leaves. I hope that reading this book will answer the question of how computers work for you, definitely, even if we don't dive into the minutae.

But, I will admit that I also have an alterior motive for writing this book. A lot of the topics this book will cover belong to a subfield of computing called **computer systems** (sometimes alternately called **systems programming**). As much as the industry complains about talent shortages and how hard it is to hire good developers, the problem is so much worse for teams working on the kinds of topics we cover in this book. There just aren't too many developers out there who know about or are even trying to learn about these topics.

Which is just a shame shame: systems is home to many interesting topics, and the work is both fun and challenging. Although many software development jobs ultimately boil down to correcting (or making progress despite) the mistakes of the past, system engineers often have the privilege of working on new problems and defining what the future will look like. Oftentimes the only constraints a systems engineer need worry about are the hardware limitations imposed by fundamental physics. Plus, the shortage of systems developers frankly makes it profitable to be a good one, even to a level beyond software developers in general.

In writing this book, I'm hoping I can help to address this shortage of people knowledgeable (or at least interested) in systems. I think a big limiting factor for us in the systems field is a lack of good, freely available resources: as someone who had a lot of free time, my own computer and a good deal of motivation, I still found many of these topics impenetrable while trying to self-teach, and I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had access to the high quality college education that was able to fill in the huge gaps.

In other words, I'm hoping this book convineces you to come work on systems with me, and to give you the basic tools to teach yourself systems, if that's your jam.

This book is written for computer users, enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels and experience, but you will get more out it if you already know how to program at least a little, and even more if you know enough data structures and algorithms to pass a collegel-level course. For best results, read this book from front to back instead of skipping around, since chapters build heavily on each other.
