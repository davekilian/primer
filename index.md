This is a book about how computers work: real, modern computers, like the one you just used to load this page.

It says something that we need a whole book for this. We've come a long way! The first computers may have been huge, power-hungry monsters, but they were simpler in concept than the one you're using right now. It was feasible to fit the entire design of an early computer all in one person's head; today you won't even find one *company* able to do it alone!

The meteoric rise in complexity can sometimes seem like a looming crisis, but it's also one of computing's greatest accomplishments: nobody has to know everything about your computer and how it works, and yet we're still making computers faster and better all the time.

That said, there come times when it is useful to understand the big picture of how your computer does all the things it does. And for that, you'll need a whole book &mdash; this one!

## Why Read This Book?

**Sheer curiosity**: Why not? Maybe you've been in the field a while, or maybe it's new to you. Either way, it's hard to find good information about how computers work. I myself have certainly been frustrated in the past at how quickly explanations resort to hand-waving. (Okay, sure, "the CPU is the brain of the computer," but what does *that* mean?)

**Getting into the field**: Computing is a hot field, and it's still growing. You can land a very nice job knowing how to program computers, and even more so knowing how to build them. There are plenty of boot camps out there to help you get started coding, but I find they don't tend to help you understand the code that runs your code, or the hardware underneath that &mdash; that's all locked up in high-end college degree programs.

**Improving as a developer**: Even if you're already good at writing software, knowing more about what's going on 'under the hood' will make you better. When you know why your favorite language or API works the way it does, it stops seeming so arbitrary, and it becomes easier to fit these things naturally into what you're trying to do. Better architectures, faster code and less waste!

**Making new kinds of computers**: To get bigger and faster computers (like in the cloud), smaller and lighter computers (like phones and wearable computers), or even new kinds of computing nobody's thought of yet, we're going to have to continue to evolve our computing architectures and maybe even invent some new ones. The first step of doing that is to understand what we already have, and why.

**Dispelling the magic**: If you've ever said a computing platform is 'magic,' how would you like to become one of the witches and wizards who know these dark inner secrets? It's actually pretty easy! One of my favorite things about computing is nothing is arbitrary: computers are designed by humans, for humans, and everything is there to solve an easy-to-understand problem.

## What We'll Cover

We'll start at the most basic level: what a computer is, what it does, and how you would build a simple computer using electrical circuitry. Then we'll build up to modern computers, covering topics like

* How your computer represents numbers, words, images, sound, video and more
* How developers program computers, and how these programming tools work
* The hardware devices inside your computer, and how software uses them
* Operating systems, the basic software that most programs are built on top of
* How computers network together, and how the Internet works
* Advanced topics and recent developments in the field

Our goal will be to walk you through these major moving pieces and see roughly how they work and how they fit together. We're not going to delve nto the nitty-gritty specifics: the hope is, if you have a general framework of what the pieces are and how they fit together, you can use a lot of the great reference material that's already out there to learn the details. There's plenty of stuff out there for beginners, and many articles for professionals; with this book, I'm hoping to help you bridge the gap between.

This is book is written for anyone to read and understand. You don't have to be a programmer to understand this book, but if you know how to program a lot of the concepts we'll cover will already be familiar, making this a quicker and easier read.

No matter your skill level, I still recommend reading the book linearly. The chapters build off one another, so you might end up lost if you jump around or skip stuff.

## About the Author

I'm a teacher with a background in software engineering. I've written high-performance code for the cloud, and I have backgrounds in graphics, networking and distributed storage.

I wrote this book because nothing like it exists (as far as I know), and I think it ought to. Back when I was in school I would sometimes trawl the Internet for explanations of everyday inventions and tools, and I remember every explanation of computers falling flat: ending too early, lots of handwaving, and feelings I didn't really understand the pieces and how they fit together. I continued to hit walls in my mission to understand how computers '*really*' work, as I was pulled deeper and deeper into the weeds &mdash; and that's how I ended up working on building these things :-)

This book is a culmination of over a decade of learning about and working on computers at many levels, sometimes piecing things together from historical context and occasionally reading tea leaves. I hope that reading this book will give you an idea of how hardware and software are co-designed to create all the technology you use every day.

With this book I also hope to provide a good, free resource for programmers who know the ropes and want to become more advanced. I taught myself to program in school, using a variety of different free resources I'd found online and a good bit of self practice. Later, I had the great fortune of being able to study computing at Brown University. One of the first things I learned at Brown was how rudimentary my self-taught background really was, and many 'unknown unknowns' I had never been exposed to. I value my education greatly, and I realize everyone can't have the same luck I did in getting one of that caliber; so one of my goals with this book is to help self-teachers get exposed to the things I don't think I would ever have stumbled into on my own.
