My journey in computer science and software engineering all began with a simple question:

*How do computers work?*

Seem simple enough? You may be surprised to learn that many professional software developers and hardware engineers alike would be hard-pressed to give you a clear answer, and the answers readily available on the Internet leave much to be desired. That's truly a shame, because the field of computers and information technology houses some of the most important developments of the past few decades, impacting across academia, every sector of the economy, and millions of people who uses personal computers and smartphones every day.

If you're looking to understand how computers work, the answer lies in a subfield of computer hardware and software called **computer systems**. 

I personally think everyone should learn computer systems, at least a little, whether or not you work in information technology. For one, the more you know about systems, the less computers seem like magic. For software developers especially, knowing systems can be the difference between getting stuck on weird, unfixable bugs or breezing through development without hiccups. Even for non-practioners of the field, knowing how computers work and what they can and can't do well comes in handy, especially given no matter what you do, you probably do (at least some of) it with a computer.

Systems houses many interesting topics, and the work both fun and challenging. Although many software development jobs ultimately boil down to correcting (or making progress despite) the mistakes of the past, system engineers often have the privilege of working on new problems and defining what the future will look like. Oftentimes the only constraints a systems engineer need worry about are the hardware limitations imposed by fundamental physics.

Finally, systems engineers are a rare breed, always in demand and hard to come by, which frankly makes knowing systems profitable, to a level that goes above and beyond even other sectors of the software industry. There are plenty of coding boot camps churning out developers ready to build on the latest web frameworks and app SDKs, but only a few rather obscure pipelines minting developers with the systems experience needed to build these frameworks and SDKs. Systems developers don't feel the same pressure as web and app developers constantly stay on top of recent trends and buzzwords, because systems skills tend to stay in demand and weather entire sea changes in the industry.

Anyways, these are just some of the reasons I think you should learn systems, and maybe even consider someday becoming a systems engineer someday. I wrote this book to help you do just that!

This book is a computer systems primer. We aim to answer, at a high level, what computers are and how modern computers work. We'll start by covering the concepts needed to build a minimum viable computer; from there we'll walk through a few different subfields of computer systems, building up to the kind of computer you're using right now to read this book. Then we'll branch out to computer networks, building up to the Internet you used to download this book. In culmination, you'll fully understand the process by which this book ended up in your hands &mdash; if that sounds simple, rest assured that this is no mean feat!

This book is written for computer users, enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels and experience, but you will get more out of this book if you already know how to program at least a little, and even more if you know enough data structures and algorithms to pass a collegel-level course. For best results, read this book from front to back instead of skipping around.
