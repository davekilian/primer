If you've ever thought that computers are 'too magic,' this book is for you.

I wrote this book as an introduction to a subfield of computer hardware and software that I work in, which is called **computer systems**. 

I personally think everyone should learn computer systems, at least a little, whether or not you work in information technology. For one, the more you know about systems, the less computers seem like magic. For software developers especially, knowing systems can sometimes be the difference between getting stuck on weird, unfixable bugs or breezing through development without hiccups. Even if you don't spend most of your day on a computer, knowing what computers are good and bad at comes in handy when you need one, especially since computers have become so pervasive in every field.

Systems is home to many interesting topics, and the work is both fun and challenging. Although many software development jobs ultimately boil down to correcting (or making progress despite) the mistakes of the past, system engineers often have the privilege of working on new problems and defining what the future will look like. Oftentimes the only constraints a systems engineer need worry about are the hardware limitations imposed by fundamental physics.

Systems engineers are a rare breed, always in demand and hard to come by, which frankly makes knowing systems profitable, even more so than working on computers and programming in general.There are plenty of coding boot camps churning out developers ready to build on the latest web frameworks and app SDKs, but only a few rather obscure pipelines minting developers with the systems experience needed to build these frameworks and SDKs. Systems developers don't feel the same pressure as web and app developers constantly stay on top of recent trends and buzzwords, because systems skills tend to stay in demand and weather entire sea changes in the industry.

Anyways, these are just some of the reasons I think you should learn systems, and maybe even consider someday becoming a systems engineer. I wrote this book to help you do just that!

This book is a computer systems primer. We aim to answer, at a high level, what computers are and how modern computers work. We'll start by covering the concepts needed to build a minimum viable computer; from there we'll walk through a few different subfields of computer systems, building up to the kind of computer you're using right now to read this book. Then we'll branch out to computer networks, building up to the Internet you used to download this book. In culmination, you'll fully understand the process by which this book ended up in your hands &mdash; if that sounds simple, rest assured that it was no mean feat!

This book is written for computer users, enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels and experience, but you will get more out of this book if you already know how to program at least a little, and even more if you know enough data structures and algorithms to pass a collegel-level course. For best results, read this book from front to back instead of skipping around, since chapters will often build on each other.
