If you've ever felt frustrated that computers seem like magic, or that explainations involve too much hand-waving, or if you'd just like to learn more about computers, this book is for you.

We're going to talk about how computers work. Specifically, we're going to cover real-world, modern computers, the kind you used to download and read this book just now. We'll start at the most basic level: what a computer is, what it does, and how you would build a simple computer using electrical circuitry. Then we'll build up to modern computers, covering topics like

* How your computer represents numbers, text, images, sound, video and more
* How developers program computers, and how these programming tools work
* The hardware devices inside your computer, and how software uses them
* Operating systems, the basic software that most programs are built on top of
* How computers network together, and how the Internet works
* Advanced topics and recent developments in the field

Our goal will be to walk you through these major moving pieces and see roughly how they work and how they fit together. One thing we *won't* do is delve into the nitty-gritty specifics: if you understand in general how these things work and what the goal is, there's a lot of great reference material already out there to help you learn the details. My goal with this book is to make sure you're well-enough equipped to dive deeper in any of these topics you find interesting.

I wrote this book because nothing like it exists (as far as I know), and I think it ought to. Back in school I used to spend hours trawling the Internet reading basic explanations of everyday inventions and tools, and I remember every explanation of computers and processors falling flat: ending too early, lots of handwaving, and feelings I didn't really understand anything. I eventually ended up on a research mission to understand how my computer works, and my continued failure to find a simlpe, straightforward explanation dragged me down deeper and deeper into the field &mdash;Â which brings me to today, more than a decade later, working on these computer things as a profession :-)

This book is a culmination of over a decade of learning about and working on computers at every level, sometimes piecing things together from historical context and occasionally reading tea leaves. I hope that reading this book will answer any basic questions you have about how computers work.

But, I will admit that I also have an alterior motive for writing this book. A lot of the topics this book will cover belong to a subfield of computing called **computer systems** (sometimes alternately called **systems programming**). As much as the industry complains about talent shortages and how hard it is to hire good developers, the problem is so much worse for teams working on the kinds of things we cover in this book. There just aren't too many developers out there who know about or are even trying to learn systems.

Which is just a shame shame: systems is home to many interesting topics, and the work is both fun and challenging. Although many software development jobs ultimately boil down to correcting (or making progress despite) the mistakes of the past, system engineers often have the privilege of working on new problems and defining what the future will look like. Oftentimes the only constraints a systems engineer need worry about are the hardware limitations imposed by fundamental physics. Plus, the shortage of systems developers frankly makes it profitable to be one, to a level even beyond software developers in general.

I'm hoping this book can help address this shortage of people knowledgeable (or at least interested) in systems. I think a big limiting factor for us in the systems field is a lack of good, freely available learning resources: as someone who had a lot of free time, my own computer and motivation, I was woefully unable to teach myself a lot of the things discussed in this book (and not for lack of trying); I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had access to the high quality college education that filled in my background on systems, and I'm hoping to share this knowledge with you, using this book.

In other words, I'm hoping this book convinces you to come work on systems with me, and to give you the basic tools to teach yourself systems, if that's your jam.

This book is written for computer users, enthusiasts and programmers of all skill levels and experience, but you will get more out it if you already know how to program at least a little, and even more if you know enough data structures and algorithms to pass a collegel-level course. For best results, read this book from front to back instead of skipping around, since chapters build heavily on each other.
