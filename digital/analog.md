Here's some old content that used to appear on the previous page, but was cut for brevity. A bunch is starting to get into some of the ideas of mechanical computers, so it might be better here on this page

Let's take a look at how we transitioned from computers as people to computing machines!

Trying to make machines compute for us instead of relying on people is by no means a new idea! But, for a long time, the situation was sort of the opposite of the old saying, "*Where there's a will, there's a way*" &mdash; for a long time, people *wanted* computing machines, but couldn't figure out how to make a good, reliable, cost-effective one. There was a will, but no way!

That's not to say they didn't try...

## Tick-Tock

Let's do a little experiment: pick a time and a place in history, any time before 1900. Using the technology people had then and there, how would you design a machine that can do calculations on numbers? Any idea how you could make it programmable?

Think about it for a minute, then continue on!

So! I wonder if you came up with something like this thing?

If we want to make machines that can do calculations, clocks and watches are a great place to look for inspiration! Fundamentally, clocks are counting machines &mdash; they count how many seconds have passed since 12 o'clock. That's useful to us because a machine that can count isn't too far off from a machine that can add! Plus, clocks have hands that move at different speeds, to measure time in different units &mdash; that points to some kind of mechanical way to multiply and divide. A machine that can count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide sounds like exactly the kind of thing we're interested in, right? Actually, yes! But there's a catch.

If you crack open a pocket watch, you'll see a small mess of gears, shafts and pulleys:

Early computing machines were built in a similar way. And they worked &mdash; sort of. It's just that they were incredibly expensive and had a tendency to break if not expertly maintained. Today, mechanical watches are still expensive and considered peak craftsmanship, even with  modern technology, so it's no wonder people had trouble crafting even *more* complicated machines using older technology!

These mechanical computers, built using clock-like principles, were the best we had for a long time, but they weren't good enough for much practical use, so they were rare. People mostly didn't bother with these machines, and hired people to help them with their calculations instead. Hence computer-the-job, like from the last chapter!

A few things happened in the early 1900s that made people reconsider these machines:

* **Electricity**: Electrical power to businesses and homes became normal. That made it possible to run computers on motors instead of hand cranks, which lets you make bigger and badder computing machines!
* **Materials**: Throughout the 1800s and into the early 1900s, we figured out how to make ever stronger, lighter, cheaper metals &mdash; exactly the kind you need for your machine!

* **Processes**: Factory innovations like the assembly line made it even cheaper to mass-produce the kinds of parts you need for a computer.

Around this time, people interested in computing saw all these things happening and started to wonder if they could bring costs down and reliability up enough for mechanical computers to feasibly replace people. As it happens, that strategy didn't pan out &mdash; modern computers don't look like pocket watches on the inside &mdash; but the renewed interest in making computing machines lead us to the basic design we *do* use in computers today. For that design, we can thank Claude Shannon, the main character for our upcoming chapter!
