title: A Basic Sketch&#58; Peripherals
---

We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We have designed what, even today, still seems like a technical marvel, and filling in the details might already sound a little daunting. Despite all of the amazing work we have done together throughout this chapter, I am sad to report we, so far, have managed to design a largely useless computer. A technical marvel with about zero practical real-world applications.

Womp, womp. What went wrong?

Well, there's no way for a person to *use* this computer! There's no way to input data. There's no way to program the computer. There's no way to get the results of any computation we do. How is a human, in the real world, supposed to use this thing?

> How do we make this work? Outline some strategies. Weâ€™ll come back later.



> Congratulations on completing your whirlwind tour of how computers work. We're not out of the woods yet though. Over the next couple chapters, we'll take a deeper look at how you construct an electrical circuit to implement a von Neumann computing architecture and design programs for it.
