title: A Basic Sketch&#58; Peripherals
---

Despite all of the amazing work we have done together throughout this chapter, we still managed to build a largely useless computer. Womp womp. What went wrong?

Well, there's no way to get data into the computer. Or out of the computer. Or program it. How is a human, in the real world, supposed to use this thing?

> Peripherals. Common device classes
>
> How do we make this work? Outline some strategies. Weâ€™ll come back later.



> Congratulations on completing your whirlwind tour of how computers work. We're not out of the woods yet though. Over the next couple chapters, we'll take a deeper look at how you construct an electrical circuit to implement a von Neumann computing architecture and design programs for it.
