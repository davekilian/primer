title: A Basic Sketch
---

In the previous chapter, we learned a little about computers and programs. We decided that a computer is a *programmble calculator*, which means that you give a computer a *program* (which is just a sequence of calculations), and the computer *executes* the program by carrying out each step on its internal calculator.

Now, how does one go about building one of these things? In this chapter we will lay out a basic sketch of the path ahead of us. We'll figure out we need to do, and what problems we'll need to work out along the way. This will give us something of a map to follow over the next few chapters, over which we'll fill in the details.

If a computer is a programmable calculator, then we're going to need to work with numbers, right? Let's start there!
