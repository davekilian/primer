title: A Basic Computer
---

It is incredible to behold how fast and complex computer hardware has become since we first started building computers in earnest back in the 1940s-1950s.  [The power adapter for a modern MacBook Pro laptop includes its own onboard computer that is more powerful than the earliest Macintosh computers](https://www.ibtimes.com/your-macbook-power-adapter-has-more-powerful-processor-original-mac-2202242). For several decades, computer hardware has been improving at an exponential rate, roughly doubling in complexity every two years &mdash; the industry has managed to hit this number so consistently for such a long time that the phenomenon was even given a name: [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law).

In this chapter we will build ourselves a "minimum viable" computer. While this computer we will describe meets all reasonable definitions of the term "computer," and even resembles some of the first computers ever built, it will be a vast oversimplification of the computers we use today.
