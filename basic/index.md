title: A Basic Sketch
---

In the previous chapter, we learned a little about computers and programs. We decided that a computer is a *programmble calculator*, which means that you give a computer a *program* (which is just a sequence of calculations), and the computer *executes* the program by carrying out each step on its internal calculator.

We also learned that "computer" used to be a job title, but nowadays that job is done by machines based on electrical circuits.

Now, how does one go about building one of these things?

In this chapter, we will lay out a basic sketch of how one uses electrical circuitry to design and build a computer. As a sketch, what we describe will be missing a lot of detail &mdash;Â this sketch is intended to be something of a map to follow over the next few chapters, where we flesh out the design and fill in more of the details.

If a computer is a programmable calculator, we're going to be working with numbers right? That seems like a reasonable place to start, so let's start there!
