title: A Basic Computer&#58; Circuits
---

> Cover any basics we want to about what a circuit is. Probably good enough to introduce schematic diagrams showing a power source with a positive and negative terminal and a wire connecting the two, with a reminder that charge flows from negative to positive (show with arrows)
>
> Probably also good to explain why the convention is negative-to-positive. Basically, the original physicists studying electricity got it backwards, and now we're in way too deep to fix it. oops!
>
> Mention in passing that typically you want to hook *something* to that circuit, and that there are tools that you can use to store charge (capacitors) and shed charge (resistors), but we won't concern ourselves with those details here.
>
> Explain the properties of the transistor
>
> Note the transistor is the basic building block of digital circuits, which is why Moore's Law (link to Wikipedia again) measures the progress in terms of number of transistors.
>
> Introduce logic-gates, and build them out of transistors
>
> Now we can 'zoom' out to  the 'logic' level. Show logical circuit diagrams. Remember when reading that diagrams 
>
> As an aside, note that once you're looking at the 'logic' level, you never think about current or voltages ever again. In fact, you could even build a logic circuit out of something other than electrical charges and impulses. Link to a water computer or something.
>
> Back to logical circuits, start by building a few mathematical tools, like an adder, multiplier, shifter
>
> Build flipflops and maybe SRAM(?) for storing the numbers you want to input, and the numbers you want to output
>
> Now we can build a calculator - almost. We currently have a separate calculator for each type of thing, which is kind of useless. Build multiplexers and demultiplexers for aggregating and selecting values. Now you can build a real calculator.
>
> What we have on our hands is a sort of proto-computer. We'll
