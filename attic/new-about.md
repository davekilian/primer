This is book is about the *how*, *why* and *what-if* of computing. Pick up a phone, a laptop, or a tablet and ask yourself: how does this thing work? Why make it work that way? If things had gone differently, what might we have ended up with instead? And, as technology continues to evolve, what will we change about the way these things work?

The design of your computer tells a story: of people, older computers, problems and solutions. If you tried to understand a computer by dividing it up into pieces, you'd end up with an absurd level of complexity and still miss important context. By tracing the story step by step, you'll find each each step to be simple and reasonable. After all, computers are invented, not discovered; not one aspect of your device existed until someone thought to make it that way.

In this book we will follow the trail of the steps that got us to where we are today. We'll see some of the paths we didn't take, and maybe even catch a glimpse of the path ahead.

This is a book for programmers, but we won't do much programming in this book. I hope to change the way you think about the 'platform' of hardware and software that supports your code. You can get far without understanding this stuff, but so long as you don't understand the platform, you have to accept it for what it is. But if you learn it, you can change it. You can drive the evolution of computing, even spearhead a new direction. You can be a conscientious consumer of the platform, writing simpler code that integrates neatly runs faster.

TODO can we condense the upcoming heading into a single paragraph and keep it short and sweet?





## What discipline is this?

I studied computer science in college. I learned a ton, but I also graduated with only the faintest idea of how computers work "under the hood"". I'm not alone in this. Computers are a rich area of study, and there are many ways to go about understanding them; but questions of how and why don't fit neatly into any of the usual degree tracks.

TODO let's say not computer engineering first so we can fix the segue below

Computer science doesn't answer these questions. If anything, computer scientists try hard to avoid talking about computers! In computer science, you identify patterns that occur commonly in programs and study them using mathematics. The less you assume about how the computer works, the more broadly you can apply your data structure or algorithm, so if you're doing pure computer science, you *actively* ignoring what goes on under the hood!

TODO but there's a set of classes hiding out in the CS degree that don't fit this bill, and are closer to what we want.
