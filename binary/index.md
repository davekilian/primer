title: Binary
---

One of the key ideas we came up with in the previous chapter was to use binary any time we need to represent a number in our computer. We'll see later in this book that all the *other* stuff you might want to represent a computer (things like pictures, videos, sound, text) is all represented as numbers &mdash; binary numbers. It would seem we need to become experts on binary numbering.

Luckily for us, binary really isn't that big of a field. We can tackle everything we need to cover about binary in just one chapter. So let's get cracking!

This chapter will begin by talking about binary itself. We covered a little of this in the previous chapter, but this time we're going to go slower, and in more depth. We'll talk about how you count in binary, and think about how binary compares and contrasts with the "real" numbering system you and I use all the time.

Then we'll talk about "Boolean" math: the math of single-digit binary numbers. Boolean math gives us some of the most basic operations we will use when we design the circuitry for doing calculations.

Finally, we'll look at multi-digit binary numbers and how to do arithmetic on them: things like adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two multi-digit binary numbers.

And with that, we'll know everything we needed to about how binary works in a computer. So let's get moving!
