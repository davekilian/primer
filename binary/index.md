title: Binary
---

As we saw in the previous chapter, our computer will use binary any time we need to represent a number. As we'll see later in this book, all the other stuff we might want to represent on a computer &mdash; like pictures, video, sounds and text &mdash; is also represented using binary numbering. It would seem like we need to become experts in the mathematics of binary numbers. Luckily for us, it's not a very big field. We can tackle the whole thing in one chapter!

This chapter will begin by talking about binary itself in more depth. We'll talk about how you count in binary, and think about how binary compares and contrasts with the "real" numbering system you and I use all the time.

Then we'll talk about "Boolean" math: the math of single-digit binary numbers. Boolean math gives us some of the most basic operations we will use when we design the circuitry for doing calculations.

Finally, we'll look at more complex arithmetic operations on binary numbers. We'll figure how to add and multiply binary numbers with any numbers of digits.

Once we have all of this nailed down, we'll have the mathematical background needed to start designing circuits, in the next chapter. Enjoy!
